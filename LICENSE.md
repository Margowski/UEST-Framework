## Additional UEST Protective Clauses *(Legally Binding Addendum)*

### A. No AI or LLM Commercial Training  
The material may **not** be used to train, fine-tune, or evaluate machine learning  
models intended for **commercial**, **industrial**, or **proprietary** use.

### B. Restriction on Use of the UEST Name  
The terms **"UEST"**, **"Unified Energy–Structure–Tension"**,  
**"Emergent Structural Time"**, **"Structural Sensitivity Σ"**,  
**"UEST Mapping Algorithm"**, and all related terminology may **not** be used to imply:  
- product certification  
- commercial validity  
- endorsement  
- affiliation  
- or scientific approval  

unless explicit written permission from the author is obtained.

### C. No Derivative Patents Without Permission  
You may not file, claim, or pursue patents that directly use, extend, depend upon,  
or operationalize concepts, methods, terminology, or algorithms from the UEST framework  
without explicit written permission by the author.

This ensures that the framework remains **open, non-commercial, and academically accessible**.
